> ## Heuristic 3 - User Control and Freedom
> Something I need to consider is easy ways
> out of situations people don't want to be in.
> For this reason, I want to implement two things.
> One: Easy logout button in case someone doesn't
> feel safe or just needs to leave quickly. Two:
> Easy access to Sell/Buy button when already in
> buying or selling menu. The reason behind number
> two is that after the user picks which menu
> they want, they may not want to go all the way
> back to the home page just to change which one
> they were in. So for this problem, my solution
> is to add a "+" button where users can pick
> their information in a quick hot-bar rather
> than the more specific menu page. The image
> below shows an example of both ideas on a previous
> website I made.

> ## Heuristic 8 - Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
> While users are in the buyer's menu (Don't have a link
> as those locations are # right now) I would like
> to make the area less cluttered than how it was
> originally was intended to look. The intended look
> (Image below) shows a lot of information about
> the possible purchase. I feel that though having 
> that information can help the user decide if a 
> product is worth their time, I do feel it's too much
> in one area (Everything in the middle that talks
> about the product details). I intend to fix this by
> getting rid of the rating (Would had been the user 
> reviews) sales, follow (Wasn't going to be there), 
> and personalization (Wasn't going to be there). 
> This way there won't be so much information 
> that if not asked for doesn't need to be on the page.

> ## Heuristic #10 - Help and Documentation
> Something I wasn't originally planning on doing
> but want to implement help/documentation on
> the [About](https://warframe-market.onrender.com/about) page on how to use the buyers
> menu as well as the sellers. I want to do this
> because I don't want users to be lost in how
> things work on the website and since buying
> and selling are core to the site, I want
> zero confusion.

> # Warframe Market | Typography & Colors
> ## Color pattern and reasons behind it for website
>
> ## Typography
> So far I have decided that the best approuch
> is to have the text sizes to be default. The
> default sizes being used right now is for the
> tags: p, h1, and h2 (currently).
>
> As for color of text, I am going for mostly
> black or white depending on what's more
> visible for the situation.
>
> ## Color
> As for a scheme, I want to stick with a light
> purple gradient and light blue or dark cyan.
> Though with concideration with a pattern
> that is predefinded, I found a decient color
> scheme that I am concidering. The hex colors
> are #9468BA #704099 #4A6078 #4B735E #61786C.
