Development Process
-------------------
### Inspiration & Development Location
As noted in the design.md and README.md files,
this project was inspired by a website and
Microsoft application called "Warframe Market".
That program is a fan-based creation made for
people who play the video game "Warframe" which
was developed by Digital Extremes. As a 
frequent user of that application, I felt
creating a similar program would count toward
encouragement of making a project for Software
Quality Control class. This program was made
mostly at school and home in my room.

### Implementing Previous Knowledge
With an experience in database creation and
website languages like HTML, CSS, and JS I
found re-entering those languages for this
program felt very welcoming as it gave me the
opportunity to put together what I knew to make
something great.

### Learning New Things
Learning new languages and concepts was
a challenge with getting everything
to work as intended. Ejs, Express, & Jasmine
where the harder part of this program
creation as not only was it incorporating a new
language, it was also introducing new ideas
entirely. More specifically, the challenge was learning
about API, database connection, fetch, and in
general understanding of the new languages and their
purposes.

Things That Went Well
---------------------
### Getting back into HTML, CSS, & JS
Getting back to the clean square one was a
great experience for me as it encouraged me to
test my knowledge. In the end, I got reassurance
of my abilities to work with them as well as
allowing me to explore new ones. The biggest 
accomplishment for me while developing was 
introducing a popup and getting its CSS to
look at least decent.

### Learning new things
This project gave me a chance to learn and
understand the reasons for pre-made testing,
which before was something that I didn't feel
the need for as most of my programs was small
enough that simple console logs did the trick.
I also got the chance to feel at least kind of
comfortable with Jasmine (still struggle with
creating tests though).

Things That Didn't Go So Well
-----------------------------
### Implementing the class-taught concepts
The hardest part of making this program the
way I imagined it to be was getting the newly
learned languages and their concepts into the
project. The reason behind this was due to the
previous issues of understanding them in the first
place. I struggled to get the new content
learned as most new and deal-breaking (important)
information was only taught via the dictionary
documentation and then was used in the course as
if we (the students) were already experts. This
issue leads to most of the issues with not all the
concepts in this application able to be implemented.

### Having time to implement everything
Time is always the problem for most things. I
feel that if I had a bit better understanding
of things and more time to implement it, I think
I could get everything on this site done and working
as intended. The expectation for this program are a bit
high, but nothing I don't think I couldn't get together
with a lot of extra time on my hands.

Conclusion
----------
At the end of it all, I am very proud of what I was
able to produce from mostly scratch with very little
"copying" from others (Like templates). Meaning I am
very proud of my abilities that I was able to make
what I did. I was able to learn a lot from what was
taught me thoroughly and implement those things
in this project (everything else I couldn't). Even
though this project doesn't have everything required
and doesn't have everything that we were introduced to
yet, I am still very proud of it and still came out with
new knowledge.
