# Warframe Market (Re-Write)
Maldach1

This project will result in a database-backed website that 
logs information about what items are up for sale and their 
details. This will also keep info on each account and their 
items logs.

This is inspired from [Warframe Market](https://warframe.market)
*I don't claim that site nor do I wish to commerically use this*
*website. I wish to just simulate their design from a different*
*approuch.*
